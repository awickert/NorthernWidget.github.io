The ALog Shield is an conventional Arduino Uno compatible shield which is designed to provide many of the essential and common features of a data logger (RTC, SD card, reference resistors for thermistors, etc), while also providing the very user friendly screw terminal connections to the board. 

This system was designed to allow users to either make a very cheap logger out of an Uno they already had, or to use as a low cost development platform for software which eventually would be transfered to a more integrated data logger.
