The Skunkworks of Northern Widget focuses on the research and development of new and interesting systems, we have separated this from Northern Widget LLC to try to be able to document projects which are in the midst of development and may never make it to the mainstream, without cluttering the production products from Northern Widget LLC. 

If you are interested in seeing what is in the pipeline at the Skunkworks, checkout our website or our github page 

If you like what you see or would be interested in one of the products from the Skunkworks, let us know! This lets us know there is a demand and makes it more likely we will put that system into production.
